## General Info 
  The app main purpose is to enable you to easily learn english words by adding them to your own word library and playing interactive games with them. As for now a translation for over 3000 words is supported and if in any case you would be interested in adding more please contact me via gh.
## Functionality
  ### Adding new Words
  #### Writing and microphone
   By visiting the typing/microphone button which can be found in page words you can add new words to your collection. It doesn't matter whether you write/say   them in english or polish since the translation works both ways. If the word isn't found in site dictionary it won't be added to your collection.
  #### Scan
  Another way to add words would be adding a document from which you wanna use your words by using SCAN button in words page.The algorithm will found all the words
  try to find what scanned words can be found in the site dictionary and add them to the word library if they are found.For example trying adding the following image   with scan option.
